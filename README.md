## NOTE: This is in progress
- I am working to design a course for those interested in learning design patterns. I have started this in Dart because I was learning Dart at the time to make some fun games and applications - however, I will slowly be transforming this project into C++ as that is the language I use professionally at work, and the one I think is more suitable for a course like this (one could make the argument for Java, but I am just simply more comfortable teaching in C++ as I have worked in that language for a very ... *sighs in old person* .. very long time). 

I will, of course, leave the Dart examples in the repository if anyone is interested in them, but as far as the actual course when it is done it will be in C++.
